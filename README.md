# First Day Repository

Welcome to Numerical Analysis with Dr. De Silva! This repository will serve as your first step into a world that unites mathematics and computer programming. Below you will find information about the structure of this **repository**.

>ðŸ’¡ A **repository** is a central place where all the files and folders related to a specific project are stored and managed. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and keep a history of your work.

## Repository Structure

Here is a brief overview of the repository structure:
```
first-day-repo
â”œâ”€â”€ homework/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ homework_scratch.ipynb
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ task_1.py
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ class_notes.ipynb
```

- **homework/**: Contains the instructions and template files for the assignment. You will edit the template files directly to complete the homework.
- **README.md**: Is this file you are reading right now.
- **class_notes.ipynb**: Is what you will edit directly to write notes during class.
